# Overview

*Aws Serverless Skeleton* is built on top of AWS (Amazon Web Service) using multiple services :

* **API Gateway** 
* **DynamoDB**
* **DynamoDB Streams**
* **S3**
* **Lambda**
* **ES (Elasticsearch Service)**
* **CloudFormation**
* **CloudWatch**

## Requirements

* `python` (Python 3.x)
* `pip` (python package manager)
* `npm` (node.js package manager)
* `serverless` (serverless Framework ) https://github.com/serverless/serverless

## Installing
in order to start running the *Skeleton* on your AWS account you need to install some requirements before starting with : 

install *python3* is via `brew`:
```
brew install python3
```

install *npm* is via `brew`:
```
brew install node
```

install *serverless* is via `npm`:

```
npm install -g serverless
```

install serverless plugins:

```
cd aws-serverless-skeleton (you have to be in the repo root directory)
npm install
```

## Setup AWS 
You need to configure AWS with your own credentials. You need to install aws cli. In your python3 virtualenv, do:
```
pip3 install awscli
``` 
Then configure it:
```
aws configure
```
you will be asked to provide your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key and region (eu-west-1) and default output format (json).
once you are done, make sure the configuration is working:

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws iam list-users --output table
```
if all is well, then you are good to go!

## Deploy on AWS
by simple command from terminal:

```js
npm run deploy-dev
// for prod env 
npm run deploy-prod
```

also you could deploy the function changed , Use this to quickly upload and overwrite your AWS Lambda code on AWS, allowing you to develop faster.

```
sls deploy function -f #function_name# --stage #stage_name#
```

## Run it locally

* first of all you need to install all python and npm requirements:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```
* Install dynamodb-local: 

```
npm run dynamo-install
```

* install elasticsearch:

The below command will install elastic search in ~/sources/

```commandline
npm run elasticsearch-install
```

* Start serverless-offline, dynamodb-local and elasticsearch. Make sure above command is executed before this. 

```
npm run start
```

By default you can send your requests to ```http://localhost:3000/``` or ```http://localhost:8000/shell``` to access the web shell for dynamodb-local or ```http://localhost:9200``` for elasticsearch.

**Please note that:**

* You'll need to restart the plugin if you modify your serverless.yml or any of the default  template files.
* The event object passed to your Î»s has one extra key: { isOffline: true }. Also, process.env.IS_OFFLINE is true.
* Seed config for dynamodb-local is enabled, that's mean each table will be seeded automatically on startup from JSON files. You can start the server with fresh table by this command: ``` npm run dynamo-start ```

## Trying the service with Postman: 
To install Postman, go to the apps page and click Download for Mac / Windows / Linux depending on your platform.
[Download](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates)

after downloading *Postman* you need to add the collection of endpoint of the services to be called from [collections](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/c53ce0788ad98e7b1033)

1. from import button, choose import from url and paste the url above. 
2. right click on the collection "posts", choose edit, and then choose variables tab.
3. add key = BASE_URL and value is either: *YOUR_BASE_URL* or [local](http://localhost:3000/)
4. to run any of the requests, just select it and hit run ( to test, choose post and then "get all posts" )

## Testing

The project contains a set of unit and integration tests but before all make sure you follow this [instruction](#installing) before run test commands.

You need to install `tox` tool:

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Make sure the dynamoDb-local is ruining on your device:

```
npm run start
```

To install dev requirements and test this project against Python3.6, just type: 
 
```
tox
```
